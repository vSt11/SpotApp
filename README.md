# SpotifyLab
Public project in order to dev spotify tinder-like app 

Features aimed (Add features you would like to see developed) : 

- Connected spotify account via API (maybe other services later)

- View personal playlists on main page

- Once you click a playlist, tinder-like UX : 
  - Swipe right : keep the song
  - Swipe left : delete the song
  - Swipe up : add the song to a another playlist
  
- Discover mode 

Tools chosen (add tools that you wish to use in order to develop the app) : 
- We recommand you to use Android studio because it's easier to preview the layer, but you can also use something else
- The core of the app will be written in Kotlin, since it's increasingly used for android apps instead of Java
- The backend will rely on the Spotify API : "The Spotify Web API is based on REST principles. Data resources are accessed via standard HTTPS requests in UTF-8 format to an API endpoint. Where possible, Web API uses appropriate HTTP verbs for each action : GET, POST, DELETE, PUT.
